Build 39

Build 39 will cause issues with configs for ALL older builds, no matter what.

Why?

We changed the names of variables, first of all.

We updated the look and feel of the config (vastly improved config comments, structure, etc)

How can you update without running into errors on your live server?

Build 39 config: https://github.com/drtshock/HCFProblems/blob/master/config.yml

Changes from b38: https://github.com/drtshock/HCFProblems/commit/045abb226c4c1a4b14f349b57ab9fee92f569594

Download the build 39 config and then replace what you need.
