### Issue guidelines
##### Versioning
Please provide your `/f version` information with bug/enchancement related issues. 
##### Images
Including relevant images helps us understand and the solve the issue faster.
##### Description
Describing what steps can be taken to replicate a bug in testing is very helpful.

Fully describing a new feature or enchancement ensures what we add is accurate.

#### If you update to a new build and notice a bug, please **check** the config.yml first!
We recommend you take a backup of your factions data before you upgrade to a new build. 

This is so you can easily copy over your config values to a newly generated config if needed!
